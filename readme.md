## Installing ##

To get the forum up and running from the compiled release. Just edit the web.config and point it to a pre-existing blank database. The installer should then just kick in.

You can also install via the Web Platform installer

and also nuget

[https://www.nuget.org/packages/TheMVCForum/](https://www.nuget.org/packages/TheMVCForum/)

    Install-Package TheMVCForum

**Upgrading**

Our installer 'should' upgrade the database between versions (It can't jump multiple versions at present). But upgrading the database manually between versions should be pretty easy. We keep all changes and notes between versions in the following file which is in the source

Notes > VersionDbChanges

And the upgrade SQL scripts for each version can be found in

Installer > Db > *Version Number* > Upgrade
