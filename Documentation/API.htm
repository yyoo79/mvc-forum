<p>The MVCForum functionality is exposed through the class named &quot;MVCForumAPI&quot;. You can use an object of this type when you are writing your own code to extend MVCForum.</p>

<p>If you have downloaded the source for MVCForum then you will be able to use all the functionality within the system when you develop code.</p>

<p>If however you are developing plug-ins to MVCForum, such as badges or events, then you will only be able to access the MVC functionality via an instance of MVCForumAPI.</p>
